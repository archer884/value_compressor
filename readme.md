Value Compressor
================

An experiment in:

1. Writing raw data to disk.
2. Using specialized compression.
3. Compressing in-memory streams?

I don't know how to do most of this in Rust, although I'm pretty familiar with a lot of it in C#, so it's been interesting so far.

To view this program's output, try `hexdump -C FILE`.
